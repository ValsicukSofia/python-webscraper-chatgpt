# webscraper-chatgpt

WOW!! ChatGPT really amazed me with its power. See attached PDF document where I instructed CHATGPT & it auto generated complete code for me. Web scraping is a process of automatically extracting data from websites using scripts. 

1) I asked ChatGPT to generate code for webscrapping a dummpy book site : https://books.toscrape.com/
  - ChatGPT first generated full code to dispaly scrapped output on screen.
  - Then I asked to dump output in a csv file, it generated modified code to dump scrapped out in csv file.
  - Then I asked asked to visualize books prices in bar chart, it genrated code to visualize it in bar chart.
2) I encountered few issues for which I asked ChatGPT for help. it provided nice guidance to fix them.
3) Lastly I asked to write a unit case code to validate same webscrapper code, it generate unit test case code as well. Super Cool!!!
